Smart Loan Risk Assessment

A machine learning project that predicts loan approval risk using Random Forest Classifier with an interactive web interface built using Gradio.

Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered loan risk assessment system that analyzes various applicant features to predict whether a loan application is low-risk or high-risk. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on loan approval data and provides an intuitive web interface for real-time predictions.

Features

- Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Complete exploratory data analysis with visualization
- Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier with cross-validation
- Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly Gradio app with real-time predictions
- Risk Assessment: Provides risk level classification with confidence scores
- Comprehensive Input Validation: Handles various loan and applicant parameters

Model Features

The model uses the following 10 features for prediction:

1. Person Education - Education level (1-6 scale)
2. Person Income - Annual income in dollars
3. Person Employment Experience - Years of employment experience
4. Person Home Ownership - Home ownership status (0-3 coded)
5. Loan Amount - Requested loan amount
6. Loan Intent - Purpose of the loan (0-5 coded)
7. Loan Interest Rate - Interest rate percentage
8. Credit History Length - Years of credit history
9. Credit Score - Credit score (300-850)
10. Previous Loan Defaults - Number of previous defaults

Getting Started

Prerequisites

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn gradio joblib kagglehub

Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Ensure the model file rfcmodel (2).pkl is in the project directory

Running the Application

Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
python rfc.py

This will launch the Gradio web interface where you can:
- Input loan applicant details through an intuitive form
- Get instant risk predictions with confidence scores
- View probability breakdowns for both risk levels
- Test with pre-configured examples

Option 2: Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Loan.ipynb

Use this for:
- Data exploration and analysis
- Model training and evaluation
- Understanding the machine learning pipeline

Model Performance

- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Cross-validation: 10-fold cross-validation implemented
- Features: 10 carefully selected features
- Data Source: Kaggle loan approval classification dataset
- Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling

Web Interface Features

The Gradio application includes:

Organized Input Sections:
  - Personal Information
  - Loan Information  
  - Credit Information

Real-time Results:
  - Risk level classification (Low Risk/High Risk)
  - Confidence percentage
  - Probability breakdown
  - Color-coded results for easy interpretation

User Experience:
  - Responsive design with custom CSS
  - Input validation and helpful tooltips
  - Quick test examples for demonstration
  - Professional styling with gradient themes

Usage Examples

Low Risk Example:
- Education: Bachelor's (3)
- Income: $50,000
- Experience: 5 years
- Home: Mortgage (1)
- Loan Amount: $10,000
- Intent: Medical (2)
- Interest Rate: 12.5%
- Credit History: 8 years
- Credit Score: 650
- Previous Defaults: 0

High Risk Example:
- Education: High School (2)
- Income: $25,000
- Experience: 1 year
- Home: Rent (0)
- Loan Amount: $20,000
- Intent: Personal (0)
- Interest Rate: 22.5%
- Credit History: 2 years
- Credit Score: 550
- Previous Defaults: 3

Security

- SSL certificate included for secure HTTPS connections
- Input validation to prevent malicious data
- Model serialization using joblib for security
